<p>I see you stopped and restarted the activity. Well done. Notice that the activity remembered where you where when you left and restores that state when you restart.</p>
<p>Now, let's explore the View toolbar.</p>
<p>Hit the View button (second from the left). It will open a submenu with tools to modify the view, e.g., change the size of the graphics.</p>
<p>Once you have it open, you can continue to the next task.</p>
