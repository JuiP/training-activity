<p>The Portfolio...</p>
<p>Now that you have mastered "starring" Journal entries and adding descriptive text in the Journal detail view, it is time to introduce the Portfolio activity.<br/>

</p>
<p>
1. Launch Portfolio from the Home View. You should see a slide show of your starred activities.<br/>
2. Try editing the description. Or add some comments.<br/>
3. Use the Save to PDF button on the main toolbar to save your portfolio to the Journal as a PDF that can be shared with a teacher or parent (or archived as part of the child's record of progress: not just what they know, but also, what they can do!!).<br/></p>
<p>Are you ready to learn about the Portfolio?</p>
