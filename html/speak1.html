</p>
<p>The Speak Activity is a talking face for the XO. It allows you to type in whatever you want, and hear your XO say it out loud. You can change the accent, rate and pitch of the voice as well as the shape of the eyes and mouth. You can ask any question of the Speak robot.</p>
<p>Although it seems like a simple Activity, Speak is one of the most popular Activities amongst children.</p>
<p>Speak can be used to help children learn the sound of letters, words and numbers. For example, we have seen children use Speak to help improve their basic numeracy by typing the numbers to hear how they sound, and matching them to number cards.</p>
