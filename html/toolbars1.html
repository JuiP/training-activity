<p>In this lesson we're going to learn how to use activity toolbars.</p>
<p>The toolbar is the black rectangle at the top of the screen. It contains buttons that invoke tools you use in your activity.</p>
<p>Hit the Stop button on the upper right. It will close this activity.</p>
<p>When you relaunch it (by clicking on the same icon in the Homeview you used to get started), you can continue to the next task.</p>
