<p class="heading">Changing the Nickname<br>
</p>
<p>In this lesson we're going to lean how to change our nickname on the XO.</p>
<p>The nickname is your name on the XO, and will appear all around Sugar as well as being visible on networks. You entered your nickname when you started up your XO for the very first time.</p>
<p>You can change your nickname to anything you like, and you can always change it back when you're done.</p>
<p>Go through to the next page to see how it's done, and try it for yourself!</p>
