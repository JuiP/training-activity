  <p>We group learning tasks by section. You can see what section you're in by looking at the label in the bottom left of the screen.</p>
  <p>You're in the &quot;Welcome to One Academy&quot; section, but soon you'll be in the &quot;Getting to Know the Toolbar&quot; section.</p>
  <p>You can see which sections you've completed, and jump between sections by pressing the Section icon at the top of the screen. It looks like this: <img src="../images/badge.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Open the section menu now by pressing the Section icon at the top of the screen, and close it by pressing it again.</p>
  <p>You will be able to hit Next after you have completed this small task.</p>
