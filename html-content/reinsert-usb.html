  <p>Please remove your USB key from the XO, and insert it into a different slot. You'll find a second USB slot on the other side of your XO. Once you have re-inserted your USB key, press okay. The Sugar Labs Academy activity will close. But don't worry. Just start it again and we can continue where we left off.</p>
