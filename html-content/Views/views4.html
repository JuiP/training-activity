    <p>Adding a Favourite to the Home View</p>
  </div>
  <p>The home view is where all your activity icons live. You can switch it between two different modes: Favourites and List.</p>
  <p>List <img src="../images/view-list.svg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> will show you all the available activities. Predictably it does so in the form of a list.</p>
  <p>Favourites <img src="../images/view-radial.svg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> will show you only the activities that you tell it to. You are probably familiar with this mode as it's already set up, and likely showing activities in a spiral shape.</p>
  <p>By going to list <img src="../images/view-list.svg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> view, you can click the star <img src="../images/emblem-favorite.svg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> next to an activity and add it to your favourites.</p>
