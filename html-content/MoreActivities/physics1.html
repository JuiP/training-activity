    <p>What is the Physics Activity?</p>
  </div>
<p>The Physics Activity <img src="../images/activity-physics.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> lets you create objects, drop them, collide them, pin them into place or even link them together via joints and chains to build your own contraptions.</p>
<p>These contraptions are even shareable with others via the Share Activity function, but a little more about that later.</p>
<p>This next task is a little different from the others, just open the Physics Activity, start drawing shapes and have a play. Don't forget to have fun!</p>
