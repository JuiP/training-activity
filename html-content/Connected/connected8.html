  <p>One more thing to note before we wrap up this section: as we mentioned earlier, we track your progress on our One Academy server. Now that you are connected, we can send a message to our server after each completed section and display a notification on the toolbar to let you know if the message has arrived.</p>
  <p>Green means all is well. <img src="../images/transfer-complete.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> Red means that there was a problem. <img src="../images/transfer-failed.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/></p>
  <p>You can dismiss these notifications by clicking on them.</p>
  <p>Hit Next to continue.</p>
