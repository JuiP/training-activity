    <p>The Network View</p>
  </div>
  <p>You can reach the Network view by pressing <img src="../images/zoom-neighborhood.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> on your keyboard. Don't do it yet.</p>
  <p>There are three kinds of symbol on the Network view:</p>
  <p><img src="../images/network-wireless-100.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> is a Wi-Fi network (it has a lock <img src="../images/emblem-locked.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> if you need a password);</p>
  <p><img src="../images/computer-xo.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> is another XO that you can connect to (more on this later);</p>
  <p><img src="../images/network-adhoc-1.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> is an ad-hoc network (which is used to connect computers to each other without the Internet).</p>
  <p>In this case, we are concerned with available Wi-Fi networks.</p>
