    <p>The Network View</p>
  </div>
  <p>You can reach the Network view by pressing <img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> on your keyboard. Don't do it yet.</p>
  <p>There are three kinds of symbol on the network view:</p>
  <p><img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> is a wi-fi network, it has a lock <img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> if you need a password</p>
  <p><img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> is another XO that you can connect to (more on this later)</p>
  <p><img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> is an ad-hoc network</p>
  <p>In this case, we are concerned with available wi-fi networks.</p>
