  <p>Proxy Servers</p>
  <p>A proxy server is a computer system that acts as an intermediary for requests from computers seeking resources from other computers. A computer connects to the proxy server, requesting some service (such as access to a web page). The proxy server evaluates the request and then (in most cases) passes the request along. Many schools use proxy services for the purposes of security and privacy.</p>
