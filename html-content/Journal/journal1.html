    <p>Getting to Know the Journal</p>
  </div>
  <p> The Journal keeps a record of your activity in Sugar; it's where you find and organise your pictures, documents, files and the different things you've created in various activities. You can search the Journal to revisit your earlier work.</p>
  <p>The Journal is also where Sugar stores the descriptions of what you've been doing while using an activity.</p>
  <p>And from the Journal you are able to read from and write to USB sticks; and it's where you'll find files that you have downloaded from the Internet.</p>
  <p>Hit Next to learn more about the Journal.</p>
