    <p>Getting to Know the Journal</p>
  </div>
  <p> The Journal keeps a record of your activity in Sugar, it's where you find and organise your pictures, documents, files and the different things you've done in various activities.</p>
  <p>When you describe what you've been doing in an activity, this is where it ends up - complete with your description so you can find that piece of work or play again.</p>
  <p>The Journal is also able to read USB sticks that you have plugged in and is where you'll find files that you have saved from the Internet.</p>
