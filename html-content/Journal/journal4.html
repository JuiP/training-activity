  <p>The Portfolio activity <img src="img/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> is a fun way to show off the work you've been doing on your XO.</p>
  <p>By starring items in your Journal, you can then have them turned into a presentation via the Portfolio activity. You can then save that presentation as a PDF and show it to others!</p>
  <p>In the next task you will star some of your work in the Journal, open the Portfolio, hit play and save the presentation as a PDF.</p>
