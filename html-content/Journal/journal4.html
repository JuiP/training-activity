  <p>The Portfolio Activity <img src="../images/activity-portfolio.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> is a fun way to show off the work you've been doing on your XO.</p>
  <p>By starring items in your Journal, you can then have them turned into a presentation via the Portfolio Activity. You can then save that presentation as a PDF and share it with others!</p>
  <p>In the next task you will star some of your work in the Journal, open the Portfolio, hit play to watch your presentation, and finally save it as a PDF.</p>
  <p>Hit Next to watch the Portfolio video!</p>
