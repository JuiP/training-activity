    <p>Viewing the Journal and Describing Activity</p>

  <p> There are a few ways to get to the Journal, but the first one we'll use is on the keyboard.</p>
  <p>When it's time for your turn, press <img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> on the keyboard to open the Journal.</p>
  <p>Once you're there, you're going to learn to view activity in the journal, describe it, and get back to the list view - before coming back to One Academy to learn more!</p>
