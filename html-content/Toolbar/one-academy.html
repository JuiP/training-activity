  <p>To help classrooms unlock the full potential of the XO, we’ve created One Academy – a supportive and inspiring learning framework for XO users. It’s a system that rewards adults and children for learning specific XO-related skills, from the very basic to the very advanced. One Academy is designed to make learning fun, engaging and rewarding, and to encourage participants to keep adding to their skillset.</p>
