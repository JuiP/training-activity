    <p>Stopping an Activity</p>

  <p>The most important item on the Toolbar is the Stop Activity item.</p>
  <p>You probably guessed that it's the stop sign symbol: <img src="../images/activity-stop.svg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Pressing Stop Activity will quit the activity you're currently using.</p>
  <p>On the next page is an animation showing how to stop an activity, and how to re-open One Academy.</p>
  <p>The next page is also your first official task, and counts towards completing this section.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this task you will:</p>
  <p>Stop the One Academy activity by pressing <img src="../images/activity-stop.svg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> and then re-open One Academy by pressing <img src="../images/one-academy.svg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> on the Home view.</p>
