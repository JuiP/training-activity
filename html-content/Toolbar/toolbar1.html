  <p> The Toolbar is the black bar at the top of the screen that's covered in icons:  </p>
  <p><img src="../images/toolbar.png" width="960" height="66" alt=""/></p>
  <p>This is where all the utilities and menu items are located for the Activity* you're using. You're currently using the <a href="one-academy.html" onclick="return popitup('one-academy.html')">One Academy</a> Activity.</p>
  <p>You've already learned about the Section menu, so we're going to cover a few other important menu items.</p>
  <p>Hit Next.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>* In Sugar, we refer to &quot;Apps&quot; as &quot;Activities&quot; to reflect our predilection for active learning.</p>
