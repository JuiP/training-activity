  <p>The Activity menu <img src="../images/toolbar-activity.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> contains tools and options that are specific to the activity you're using. In some Activities, you might find options for saving to different file formats. For example, in the Write Activity, a document can be saved as plain text (TXT) or in rich text format (RTF).</p>
  <p>In this case, we're going to take a look at the Description tool.</p>
  <p>The Description tool <img src="../images/edit-description.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> lets us log some information about what we were doing with the current activity in our Journal (more about that later.)</p>
  <p>Watch a video on the next page to see what to do!</p>
