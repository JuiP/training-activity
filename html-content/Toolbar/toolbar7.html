  <p>The Activity menu <img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> contains tools and options that are specific to the activity you're using. You might find options for saving to different file formats in another activity, for example.</p>
  <p>In this case, we're going to take a look at the Description tool.</p>
  <p>The Description tool <img src="../images/placeholder40x40.jpeg" width="40" height="40" alt=""/> lets us log some information about what we were doing with the current activity in our Journal (more about that later.)</p>
  <p>Watch a video on the next page to see what to do!</p>
