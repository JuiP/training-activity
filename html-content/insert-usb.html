You will need to plug your USB stick into the side of the XO <i>before</i> running this app.<br>
  If you're not sure how to do this, refresh your memory at:</p>

  <p>Your progress will be stored on this USB stick so that if you have to complete your training on another XO, all you need to do is plug in your USB stick to carry your progress over.</p>
  <p>If you lose your USB stick, there will still be a copy of your progress on this XO - so don't worry.</p>
