    <p>Changing the Sugar Nickname and Colours</p>
  </div>
  <p>When you started Sugar for the very first time, you were asked to provide a nickname and choose some colours.</p>
  <p>Maybe you're still happy with them, maybe you're not.</p>
  <p>In this task, you're going to find the Sugar settings, the About Me section, change your nickname and colours &ndash; then restart Sugar so that your changes take effect. Finally you'll open the One Academy Activity again so that you can continue with your learning!</p>
  <p>Hit Next to see how.</p>
