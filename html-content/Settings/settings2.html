    <p>Changing the XO Nickname and Colours</p>
  </div>
  <p>When you started your XO for the very first time, you were asked to provide a nickname and choose some colours.</p>
  <p>Maybe you're still happy with them, maybe you're not.</p>
  <p>In this task, we're going to find the XO settings, the About Me section, change our nickname and colours - then restart Sugar so that our changes take effect. Finally we'll open One Academy again so that we can continue with our training!</p>
