    <p>Make Speak Talk to You</p>
  </div>
  <p>Speak <img src="../images/activity-speak.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> is a text-to-speech activity that kids love. Put text in the box, and the Speak robot will say it out loud! Some children will even get Speak to read books to them.</p>
  <p>You can change how the robot looks and sounds, and even ask it basic questions.</p>
  <p>In the next task you'll paste the text you copied from Write into Speak with Ctrl+V and get the robot to say it aloud. Then you'll ask the robot &quot;Where is the capital of Australia?&quot;, change the look of the robot, describe your work to the Journal and finally Stop the Speak activity.</p>
