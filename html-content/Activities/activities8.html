    <p>One more note regarding activities: by default, when you click on an activity in the Home View you reopen the most recent &quot;instance&quot; of that activity. For example, if you had been using the Write activity and click on its icon, you will continue editing the same document.</p>
    <p>If you want to open a new document, you need to &quot;right-click&quot; on the activity icon to bring up a menu. Select &quot;Start new&quot;.</p>
    <p>You can use the same menu to access previous work.</p>
