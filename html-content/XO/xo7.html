    <p>Change the Screen Orientation</p>
  </div>
  <p>Another trick your XO can do is change the orientation of its screen. This is great for reading books and documents.</p>
  <p>The rotate screen button is located just under the gamepad direction buttons, and looks like this <img src="../images/rotate.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Try pressing <img src="../images/rotate.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> and changing your screen orientation.</p>
  <p>You can hit Next after you've rotated the screen back to its starting orientation.</p>
