  <p>There are a few more features worth mentioning.</p>
  <p>Sunlight-Readable Screen<br>
  If you decrease the brightness of your screen to its lowest setting via the keyboard buttons <img src="../images/dimmer.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/> <img src="../images/brighter.svg" width="55" height="55" alt=""/>, the XO screen will become high contrast black and white and sunlight readable.</p>
  <p>HDMI Out<br>
  If you look on the right side of your XO screen, underneath the antenna you'll find a micro-HDMI port. This port lets you plug your XO straight into a TV or projector via a mini-HDMI to standard-HDMI cable.</p>
  <p>Microphone, speaker, USB, and SD ports<br>
  Also under the antennas are microphone and speaker ports, and two USB ports. Under the base of the screen is an SD-card slot.
